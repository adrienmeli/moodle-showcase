Beer Street and Gin Lane are two prints;issued;in 1751 by British artist William Hogarth
in support of what would;become;the Gin Act.
Designed to be;viewed;alongside each other,
they;depict;the evils of the consumption of gin as a contrast to the merits of drinking beer.
Hogarth;portrays;the inhabitants of Beer Street as happy and healthy, nourished by the native English ale,
and those who;live;in Gin Lane as destroyed by their addiction to the foreign spirit of gin.
But, as with so many of Hogarthâ€™s works, closer inspection;uncovers;other targets of his satire,
and reveals that the poverty of Gin Lane and the prosperity of Beer Street;are connected;more intimately than they at first appear.
Gin Lane;shows;shocking scenes of infanticide, starvation, madness, decay and suicide,
while Beer Street;depicts;industry, health, bonhomie and thriving commerce.
There are contrasts and subtle details that;allude;to the prosperity of Beer Street
as the cause of the misery;found;in Gin Lane.
